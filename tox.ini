# multiple versions of Python with a single command. This configuration file
# will run the test suite on all supported Python versions. To use it,

# The following sections force Tox to create virtual environments based on
# Python binaries that are (assumed to be) installed using Debian packages
# because this is required for py2deb to function properly. This forces Tox to
# sidestep the custom compiled Python binaries that are used on Travis CI by
# default. See https://github.com/paylogic/py2deb/issues/3.
